## About
This mod forces all pop-ups to respect your game's `Fast Menu` setting when playing their opening animation, as this is not enforced by default throughout the whole game.

---

### Note
<cg>Some mods</c> might <cy>force **no elastic animation** on their pop-ups</c> for one reason or another!
